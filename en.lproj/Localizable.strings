 App Descriptions

"rightnighter_description" = "Kids of the 80s know exactly what this is. Have a \"voice box\" right on your wrist with a talking animation when the time changes.\n\nOn the lefthand side you see the date and on the opposite the remaining battery.";

"chunky_description" = "A nice square design where you can choose colors and see the time in nice big numbers.\n\nThere are quite a few options as well, and goes well with any outfit you may wear!";

"lines_description" = "A very simple yet very stylish face displaying nothing but the time and date.\n\nThere are quite a few settings here as well, and of course: customizable colours. This face is soon to have larger fonts!";

"colours_description" = "This watchface is really gonna make your Pebble Time's display shine by changing the colours every minute, filling the black background with beautiful shades of colour.\n\nFind in settings the ability to change the width of these bars and other aspects of the face. Quite beautiful!";

"timedock_description" = "Official watchface for TimeDock by Engineerable! Available on the appstore. \n\nSettings include being able to open the face when plugged in, animations, and more. Check it out, it's free.";

"treeofcolours_description" = "This one will truly live on the colour screen! Every minute a 'branch' grows randomly emulating a growing branch of a tree (hence the name).\n\nEvery hour it resets itself and since the growing and coloring happens randomly it always looks different.";

"timezones_description" = "Our take on a watch face with two timezones giving you many personalizing options too!\n\nThe inner circle shows the time for the first timezone (in the above example for Philipp’s timezone) and the outer one stands for the second timezone (Edwin, in the above example).";

"slotmachine_description" = "A unique designed based around an actual slot machine. Watch the numbers shrink in and out of view as time passes by!\n\nSlot Machine comes with a few other handy features, such as battery bar and shake to animate, just in case.";

"pulse_description" = "This is another face living through its animations. We could either let the circle grow every minute or have a pulse animation every minute changing the background color.\n\nThis will really make the Pebble Time’s colour display shine!";

"simplifiedanalogue_description" = "Simplicity meets class with Simplified Analogue. \n\nWe listened to user requests and created this face: it features the digital time but with a minimal and awesome looking analogue display. Customize about every colour and turn on/off anything you don't like.";

"personal_description" = "Personal is what it says it is: Personal.\n\nCustomize Personal to show your name and see it greet you across the day. Beautifully optimized for Pebble Time's display, it truly looks amazing.";

"beat_description" = "Beat is an attractive watchface with more than enough animations which uses it's unique \"beatline\" to show information such as the battery level or bluetooth status (or if you want, have it completely random).\n\nThere are some damn cool animations that catch the eye and make it look as if your wrist is actually monitoring your heartbeat! Not to mention, you can find settings for customizing colours and other features in the Lignite companion app.";

"equalizer_description" = "Another one making your color display go wild! \n\nThe bars have many different animation modes such as roll, wave, music, and more! You can choose how often you want these to animate and more. The battery bar acts as a divider. Sports the time, weekday, and date as well.";

"upsidedown_description" = "Upside down is a funky face which is sure to make your head turn upside down as well!\n\nDisplays the hours on top along with the weather (updated every 30 minutes), and the bottom contains the minutes inverted and the date.";

"plainweather_description" = "Plain Weather, although \"plain\", brings a simple and clean interface to your Pebble Time Round that you'll love.\n\nIt updates the weather every half an hour, and is battery efficient.";
